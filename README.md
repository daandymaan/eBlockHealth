## About the Developer

Hi my name is Dan Simons, I am a TUDublin computer science graduate and long term developer. 

I developed this project as part of my final year project for the course. 

I thoroughly enjoy developing and solving problems with computer science and I'm always looking for new ways to solve problems that I see in day to day life. 

I came up with this idea during the height of Covid-19 where access to pharmacies and health centers was limited due to rampant virus. 

I thought a self service website which allows GP's pharmacies and patients could view their prescriptions and send their prescriptions through the internet would be hugely beneficial and would modernise irelands current prescription system. 

I have been interested in blockchain technology for a while and have often thought of different use cases for it such as land ownership cyrptocurrencies and other things were ownership is a key part. I thought this ePrescribing and ePrescription services would be another good use case for blockchain technology as ownership and security of prescription data and prescriptions themselves is very important. 

This project is always ongoing and I have plenty of ideas I would like to implement into this project so keep an eye out.

## About the Project 
[Dissertation Document](https://github.com/daandymaan/BlockchainPrescribing/blob/c321526981b09cc148e35e32dc4fc56b0f6ea399/Docs/Simons,%20Daniel%20C17371946%20DT228%20Final.pdf)

This project is a web-based application which is secured through the power of blockchain technology. This website allows the GP’s, Pharmacies and Patients to view and exchange their prescriptions between other user’s on the network, this exchange is carried out in a secure and reliable method using the infrastructure of blockchain. GP’s can also create prescriptions using this web application.

User’s can easily use and interact with the website, with the website providing the tools to create, view and exchange prescriptions between other user’s on the network. As this website is based on blockchain infrastructure each transaction of prescriptions that occurs on the network is  tracked and recorded. This application provides a permanent immutable history of prescription activity that occurs on the network and as nothing can be deleted off the network provides a sense of reliability on the data stored there. 

This application aims to solve issues found with most paper-based prescriptions which are lost or stolen prescriptions and prescription errors due to legibility of handwriting. These issues can all be alleviated with the use of an online self-service system where prescription ownership is monitored by security of blockchain while providing an easy to use self-reliant web application so that prescriptions can be easily created with correct and up to date information.

Previous ePrescribing systems used a centralised database to store user’s information or prescription information which has its own vulnerabilities as centralised databases are more at risk of data breaches or down time. With blockchain it provides scalability and security to data storage whilst providing continuous up time. 

This system provides a self service website for patients, GPs and Pharmacies to access prescriptions in an easy to use manner while still maintaining the security of blockchain infrastructure so that the data has integrity and is kept secure.
